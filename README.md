C++ Point of Sale Project

1. This was a school project for a 2nd semester C++ class. It was created in a series of 5 'Milestones'

2. The task for this project was to create an application that managed a list of items stocked in a store for sale. 
The application keeps track of the quantity of items in the store, saved in a file and updates their quantity as they are sold.


3. This project taught me how to use Object Oriented Programming techniques to divide a larger program into more manageable parts.
It also let me practise file input/output, abstract classes, output formatting, and more in C++.
